=========

This is how a programmer attempts to make art one pixel at a time. Project features emergent Pixel Art or Noise Generator; Seizure warning!

How to run it
-------------
Run the executable located at Pixelated/Pixelated/Pixelated/bin/x86/Debug/Pixelated.exe if you are using linux then you will need to run it
using an emulator such as wine. 

Alternatively you can build and run the project yourself using Microsoft Visual Studio, just open the Pixelated.sln project. 
You may require some dependencies such as XNA Game Studio 4.0. This way you can also view and makes changes to the source.

If you don't have MVS and you still want to view the source, it is located at Pixelated/Pixelated/Pixelated/PixelArt.cs.
